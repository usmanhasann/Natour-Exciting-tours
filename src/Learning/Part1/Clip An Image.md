# What is cliping an image ?

-The clip-path CSS property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.
-The polygon() CSS function is one of the <basic-shape> data types. It's used to draw a polygon by providing one or more pairs of coordinates, each of which represents a vertex of the shape.
